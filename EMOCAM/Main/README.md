Project Name: EmoCam
Developer: 888

Description:
------------
This project is a web application designed to assist psychologists during consultations with patients. The system includes an AI-based emotion recognition feature that analyzes patient emotions throughout the consultation session. It helps psychologists better understand the emotional states of their patients, session by session.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, with XAMPP as the local server environment. It allows psychologists to manage patients, conduct consultation sessions, and view emotional data collected during those sessions.
